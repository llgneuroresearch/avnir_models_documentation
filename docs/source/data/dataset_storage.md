# Dataset Storage

## **Important Information About Dataset Storage**

The datasets used in the lab are stored on the shared **I:\\** drive under the path: `I:\Chercheurs\Obaid_Sami\Datasets`.

### 🗂️ **Structure**
- Within the `Datasets` folder, you will find:
    - A dedicated folder for each database.
    - An Excel file named `Datasets_summary.xlsx` that provides a summary of the available databases. This file helps users quickly identify datasets relevant to their projects.

### ⚠️ **Usage Guidelines**
> **Critical Notice:**  
> - The shared library is **read-only**.  
> - To use a dataset, **copy it to your personal project folder**.  
> - **Do not edit, delete, or move the original files.**

Failure to adhere to these guidelines may disrupt access for other users and compromise the integrity of the datasets.

### 🤝 **Contributing Processed Databases**

Students are encouraged to propose making their processed databases available in the `Datasets` folder. To do so, please contact Guillaume Theaud to discuss the relevance and the appropriate method for sharing your work.
